# Social Network API

## Description
This social network API was created to be used as a backend database and server application for a social media platform. This API allows users to easily add social media user information, posts, and reactions to a MongoDB database with the intention of being utilized by a front-end web application.

## Usage
You can watch a video walkthough of this application on YouTube at 

This application can be run from a GitBash terminal using node.js by navigating to the file location and starting the application using the 'node server' command. Once the application is running, the database will be accessible using Insomnia or a similar API platform. Users can perform CRUD operations on the database using the API routes for Users and Thoughts. Thoughts are also able to have reactions posted and deleted from the database.
